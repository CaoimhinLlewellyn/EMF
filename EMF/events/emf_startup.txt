# Select a random intro event variant.

# After the very brief description of EMF, there will be space to direct
# users to the EMF wiki manual (part of the HIP wiki at hip.ckiiwiki.com),
# to give 2 lines of credit, and to allow for an extended "Did You Know?"
# that gives a brief intro / tip / explanation regarding EMF features.
#
# Some of the "Did You Know?"s will be a list of random statements about
# interesting things in the EMF world or facts about EMF itself. Ideally,
# most intro events will feature a different snippet for each campaign.
#
# It's opportunity to educate users about EMF functionality as well as
# teach them from the start that EMF is not the same repetitive game that
# CKII players are used to playing and that paying attention / being
# actively involved in the events that popup is a positive investment
# of energy. As a new player approaches EMF, it will be much easier to
# reinforce that relationship with the game if it happens from the very
# beginning of their experience with it after testing out a couple launches.
#
# This is generally the same reasoning for why EMF needs to release with
# a splash (significant content/flavor): exploit the learning curve, and
# show users from the start the type of differences that they can expect
# from the mod.

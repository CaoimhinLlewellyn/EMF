# emf_cb.0 [Attacker]
#
# A smarter version of occupy_minor_holdings_of_occupied_settlements + gain_all_occupied_titles
# that, among other things, limits the occupied title gain to only those titles within certain
# de jure territory.
#
# NOTE: Removed due to broken scripting interface for tribal vassals that are called to war by their liege, making this
# problem intractable for tribals.  Could still be used for special CBs that definitely won't encounter tribals or when,
# if ever, the fundamentally broken scripting interface for reflecting vassal/liege/realm/hostility/war-participants/etc.
# status of such tribal vassals is fixed.

# "A lie can run round the world before the truth has got its boots on."

# Should also add chronicle entries for this stuff

## Will eventually cover:
# Deaths:
# Unusual deaths for religion heads
# Deaths of Emperors
# Deaths of players?
# Titles:
# Formation of new empires, and new kingdoms within distance limits (400 or so?)
# Destruction of empires
# Loss of holy site control?

# DEATH FLAVOR NOTES:
# Different flavor depending on religion, might not send to parties who wouldn't care, might use distance as a factor, should have special flavor and rewards for the one who sacrificed (accessed through killer = {} scope), will have minor mechanics such as making Catholic folks hate the character who killed the Pope or reducing the authority of the religion whose leader was sacrificed, etc

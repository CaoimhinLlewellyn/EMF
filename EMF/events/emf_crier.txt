# DEATH FLAVOR NOTES:
# Different flavor depending on religion, might not send to parties who wouldn't care, might use distance as a factor, should have special flavor and rewards for the one who sacrificed (accessed through killer = {} scope), will have minor mechanics such as making Catholic folks hate the character who killed the Pope or reducing the authority of the religion whose leader was sacrificed, etc

# Former religion head was sacrificed by other faith
emf_crier.50.title;The [FromFrom.RelHead.GetTitle] is Dead;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.desc_norse_killer;[FromFrom.GetFirstName], the former head of the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] faith, hangs from a branch, [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] lifeless eyes bulging. Some children steal [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] preposterous hat and laugh as they pass it around. Overhead ravens are already circling, preparing for their own part in the feast.\n\nWhat will the [FromFrom.Religion.GetGroupName]s think when they learn of this glorious victory for your faith, when they learn you have killed their spiritual leader? Will they shake with fear at the sound of the Allfather's name? As you ponder these questions, the ravens descend and begin their bloody work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.desc_norse_faith;[Root.GetBestName] has sacrificed the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] [FromFrom.RelHead.GetTitle] at a Blot. Even now the so-called holy [FromFrom.GetManWoman] hangs from a tree branch, [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] corpse torn by ravens.\n\nDoes this auspicious occasion mean the eventual triumph of your [Root.Religion.GetName] faith? Or will the [FromFrom.Religion.GetGroupName]s be inspired to strike back against those they hold responsible?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.desc_sacrifice;Word has arrived that a [GetFromRootInsult] by the name of [Root.GetBestName] has captured [FromFrom.GetBestName] and then sacrificed [FromFrom.GetObjectPronoun] at a heathen ritual. While you don't know the details of it, the monstrousness of the action is clear. The former [FromFrom.RelHead.GetTitle] has been debased, desecrated, used like an animal.\n\nWhy has [FromFrom.Religion.GetHighGodName] allowed this to happen? Is this evidence that all [FromFrom.Religion.GetGroupName]s have been forsaken? Surely something must be done. Such an act cannot go unpunished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.desc_group;Word has arrived that a [GetFromRootInsult] by the name of [Root.GetBestName] has captured [FromFrom.GetBestName] of the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] faith and sacrificed [FromFrom.GetObjectPronoun] at a barbaric ritual. While it doesn't directly concern your own faith, it is still worrying.\n\nAre any good [FromFrom.Religion.GetGroupName]s safe from these foreign predations? Who else will be made victims of profane rites performed for heathen gods? Perhaps something must be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.desc_other;Rumors, spreading like wildfire, say that a [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] [FromFrom.RelHead.GetTitle] has been taken prisoner and was recently sacrificed at a ritual by [Root.GetBestName]. If true, it may signal the growing power of the [Root.Religion.GetName] people and the waning of the [FromFrom.Religion.GetGroupName]s. How powerful can they be, if they cannot protect their spiritual leaders?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.a;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is triumphant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.b;Let them try. [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] is with us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

emf_crier.503.title;End of an Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.503.desc;Whether by external pressures or internal corruption, the [emf_crier_dead_title.GetFullName] has been reduced to a remnant of its former glory. No longer seen as a true empire by others, nor able to deem itself as such without risking blasphemy, it has succumbed to its weakness and is forfeit.\n\n[From.GetDynName], the former [From.GetEmperorEmpress], has surrendered [From.GetPossPronoun] imperial crown and accepted the lesser title [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetBaseName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.503.desc_hre;Charlemagne's once great empire has submitted to a final, inglorious fate and is undone. The dream of reviving the Roman Empire in the West has ended in the same decline and ultimate destruction as befell the Romans of old.\n\n[From.GetDynName], the [From.GetManWoman] who once claimed the [emf_crier_dead_title.GetFullName] as [From.GetPossPronoun] own, has been reduced to [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetBaseName]—an ignoble fate for the last successor of Charles the Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.503.desc_byz;The Empire of the Romans has fallen! Considered by many to be the inheritor and keeper of the legacy of the Roman Empire, and once surely the foremost bastion of Christendom in the East, the [emf_crier_dead_title.GetFullName] is no more.\n\nWith the Empire broken and Constantinople in the hands of another realm, the former [From.GetEmperorEmpress], [From.GetDynName], has given up [From.GetPossPronoun] imperial throne and become [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetBaseName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.503.a;I should send [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] my sympathies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.503.b;Good riddance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

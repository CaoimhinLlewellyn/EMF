bl_mrt_desc;They say that the Dragon's of Armenia emerged from the caverns deep within the volcanic mountains of Georgia. Stories are told of how the fabled Armenian Dukes would fly atop their Dragons to Constantinople for audience with the great Emperors of Purple and Gold. How they had the power to influence the gods themselves. The mark of the Dragon is the Mark of the Great Armenian Dynasty of old. The Dragon's never falter and their fire burn always.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bl_armchair;Blood of the Dark Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bl_armchair_desc;The bloodline of George and Lawrence is eternally marked by the greatest and worst elements of humanity. Despite the reputable bloodline of both Mohammed and with glorious irony, Charlemagne, these Muslim conquerors of the British Isles and Africa are instead remembered due to their lineage of the prince of darkness himself, Lucifer. George, scion of Lucifer, during his time of rule was known across the world as the anti-Christ, sweeping through Africa, Sicily and Iberia with an army of heretics, cultists and madmen alongside his witch-concubines, obliterating the last strongholds of both African Christendom, Orthodox Sicily and the exiled Caliphs of Marrakesh. \n\nSince then, the Bloodline of the Prince of Darkness remains strong in Africa and Western Europe. Infamous for their practicing of incestuous eugenics and breeding of diabolical genius, bathing in the blood of their enemies, flaying of prisoners and satanic cabalistic rituals and witchcraft, the luciferspawn, luficerassids or whatever name they now go by strike fear into the hearts of the faithful and righteous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

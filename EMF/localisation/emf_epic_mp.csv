bl_mrt_desc;They say that the Dragon's of Armenia emerged from the caverns deep within the volcanic mountains of Georgia. Stories are told of how the fabled Armenian Dukes would fly atop their Dragons to Constantinople for audience with the great Emperors of Purple and Gold. How they had the power to influence the gods themselves. The mark of the Dragon is the Mark of the Great Armenian Dynasty of old. The Dragon's never falter and their fire burn always.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

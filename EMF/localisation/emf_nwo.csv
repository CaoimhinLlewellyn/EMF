emf_nwo.1.desc;With this scenario customization, you can change the face of the map in myriad ways, from dismantling the Christian empires and adding lots of new kingdoms with which to politick to shattering the world into independent counts and using rapid conquest CBs to etch your own new world order.\n\nFirst, select whether you want independent counts, de jure dukes, or de jure kings mode. If either of the latter, you'll have the option to retain the same rulers for existing de jure principalities (duchies or kingdoms). You'll also be asked whether to apply the new world order to the whole map, only Catholics, only Christians, or only Muslims. There will then be a number of additional choices.\n\nNote that you can run this customization decision again with different selections to get more complex results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

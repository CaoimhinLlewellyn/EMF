1.0.0 [DEV]
- [DynamicLevies] Added placeholder codegen output for dynlevy laws. Levy curve is just scaled linearly over range [0.5,0]
- Inherited PB's demesne and crown laws. PB succession laws will, pragmatically speaking, not be inherited by the EMF base
- Started drafting EMF's tweaked defines.lua. Base template was from PB. Assume PB overrides of vanilla are
  inherited, and otherwise note all of the following points of divergence, file-ordered (remainder of file to go):
	CALL_TO_WAR_DELAY = 48 (4 years, from 5) [Encourage higher alliance participation]
	SHORT_REIGN_YEARS_END = 12 (+4 from PB, +3 from vanilla) [Less steep malus curve, consistent with long reign beginning at 20 vs. default 10]
	DOW_ON_ALLY_PRESTIGE_COST = 50 (-100, return to vanilla) [Encourage succession wars]
	MAX_DUCHIES_LEGALLY_HELD = 2 (-1, return to vanilla) [Feudal hierarchy & plausibility-- else, just eat the -10 opinion]
	INTER_MUSLIM_WAR_MONTHLY_PIETY_COST = 1 (-1 from PB/vanilla) [Longer Muslim war, more MvM war, more Muslim non-MvM war]
	DOWRY_MULTIPLIER = 1.0 (-50%, return to vanilla) [Encourage stronger alliances with MRs]
	PRESTIGE_OPINION_DIV = 300 (+50% from PB, +200% from vanilla) [Harder to earn but higher cap for prestige opinion]
	PRESTIGE_OPINION_MAX = 15 (+5 from PB, -5 from vanilla) [+1op/300pr to max of +15op @ 4500pr]
	MAX_PREP_INV_TARGET_HOLDINGS = 50 (+10) [SWMH flexibility]
	MAX_PREP_INV_ATTACKER_HOLDINGS = 50 (+10) [SWMH flexibility]
	IMPRISON_CHARACTER_INTERACTION_PIETY = 0 [Various reasons]
	INVITE_TO_COURT_INTERACTION_MONEY = 25 [Realism tweak]
	ASK_FOR_INVASION_INTERACTION_THRESHOLD_FOR_YES = 125 (-25) [Attempt to make this feature actually work sometimes, 50v125]
	ASK_FOR_CLAIM_INTERACTION_THRESHOLD_FOR_YES = 125 (-25) [Attempt to make this SoA feature actually work sometimes, 50v125]
	CHANGE_AMBITION_YEARS = 1 (-1 from PB, -2 from vanilla) [More active ambition selection involvement]
	ASSIGN_ACTION_DAYS = 0 (60 in PB, 183 in vanilla) [Various reasons]
	MAX_GENERATED_TRAITS_FOR_HISTORICAL = 5 (+1) [More variance, more aligned w/ actual accumulated adult trait counts]
	LUNATIC_TRAIT_CHANCE_FACTOR = 0.4 (+100%) [From inbreeding: far, far too rare at default]
	LUNATIC_DIVINE_BLOOD_TRAIT_CHANCE_FACTOR = 0.4 [Consistency w/ above]
	MAX_REPUBLIC_COUNTIES_IN_REALM = 0.2 (+100%) [Encourage slightly more freedom in diversity of government types, patch 2.0 default was too low]
	EMPIRE_DEJURE_COUNTY_LIMIT_TO_CREATE = 0.667 (2/3 rule, -11% from PB, -16.5% from vanilla)
- FIX: Logic error regarding flag duration in 90-day pulse
- FIX: Added missing decisions = {} for isis quarterly maintenance pulse decision
- Added isis quarterly maintenance pulse for weather events (and whatever else)
	Implemented in style of high-priority AI decision: quite accurate timing, such accuracy
	or precise seasonality may not prove necessary for the weather events.

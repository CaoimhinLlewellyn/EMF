- Independence faction is now more of a threat, and in extreme cases, won't be tempered by simply being de jure vassals
- Loosened restrictions upon AI in bid_for_independence CB
- [DynamicLevies] Instantaneous hooks added for dynlevy law update upon the various independence war outcomes
- [DynamicLevies] SWMH version of levy-scaling curve: Decline begins at realm_size 25, continues in 63 further grades of 6 holdings/grade beyond that
- [DynamicLevies] Some minor optimization and prevention of dynlevy laws being set needlessly
- [DynamicLevies] Cleanup event provided for cosmetic bug/anomaly where multiple dynlevy law grades _appear_ to be activated at once (only ever sighted once, only one is truly active)
	Simply open up the console and invoke: event emf_dynlevy.24 (then refresh your Laws view to see the _cosmetic_ results)
- Norse "shield-maidens" logic made a bit more flexible; updated job ambition and combat trait advancement ambitions to match

- EMPIRE_DEJURE_COUNTY_LIMIT_TO_USURP = 0.667 (mirrors creation)
- COUNT_GRANT_TO_CHURCH_PIETY = 125 (from 50) -- more incentive to not only build temples but make temples county capitals

- [Vanilla Crusades] New customization decision: Vanilla Crusades: players may choose to use the vanilla Crusade mechanic rather than PB's different, custom mechanic
- Crusade CB requirements have been changed to more exactly follow vanilla
	Exception: lowered min. attacker religious authority to 40% (from 50%)
	Removed requirement that the attacker `is_landed = yes`
	Removed requirement that Muslims can only call Jihad for de jure kingdoms that _border_ a Muslim realm of their branch (misses multiple cases toward that end anyway)
	Slight technical change to the scope within which the schism-mended check is evaluated
	It no longer suffices for the potential target to merely hold the title-- they must always have at least 6 counties within it
	Effective battle warscore for the CB is equivalent to vanilla (37.5% of 100 == 50% of 75)
- [DynamicLevies] FIX: Primogeniture and Seniority faction CBs updated to also immediately adjust dynlevy laws upon realm fracture
- Muslims now also have access to the Burgher Obligations and Burgher Focus law sliders
- Positive councillor events now have an altered skill curve which also reflects skill levels all the way up to 30
- Combat trait advancement ambitions are now half as likely to be selected by the AI

- Holy war piety cost reduced to 200
- Defines tweaks:
	TRADE_ZONE_BONUS_MULT_CITY = 0.005 (vanilla)
	OPINION_WHEN_NO_LEADER = -100 (back to previous, experiment over)
	LEVY_PERCENT_BEFORE_CAN_RAISE = 0.2 (back to previous)
	MAX_LEADERSHIP_TRAITS = 3 (from 2)

- [Ambitions] Added comprehensive ambitions for winning a war and winning a holy war, offensive or defensive (placeholder gfx)
- Characters captured via a siege will now defer any request for mercy for 1yr, after which a 50% longer MTTH applies to the mercy request event, but non-AI requests are expedited

- Royal marriage alliances (Marriage Ties) yield +40 opinion rather than +30 opinion
- Lieges no longer inherently dislike faction members
- Bishops now only inherently like the Pope with +15 opinion rather than +20
- MAX_JOINED_FACTIONS raised to 3, to account for the fact that everybody's a member of the AF
- [DynamicLevies] The law-setting event now runs on yearly pulse as maintenance to ensure levy laws stay in sync w/ realm_size (catches faction war invalidation, various other misc. realm-splitting/realm-growing cases that involve no title transfer). NOTE: Could be optimized in the future.
- [DynamicLevies] All major_revolt CBs should now immediately reflect the proper levy laws for all sides upon CB add and valid completion
- [Holy Orders] Muslims now have two additional holy orders, one Shiite and one Sunni; flags, names, and other material should be considered placeholder and outside input and critique on them is welcome
- PB is now a hard dependency of EMF to ease maintenance and support
	All EMF code may now assume it is overriding at least PB.
	The HIP installer will shortly be updated to enforce the dependency, but simply ensuring PB is co-installed works fine for devs.

0.9.1 [ALPHA]
- [VF] Removed in-progress work on the VF that was sitting anywhere critical, as that project has been delayed (retrieve later from commit 15a03dbf)
- EMF's overrides for PB's crown laws now only apply when running with PB (previously PB's crown laws were standard for EMF)
- Resurrected the scenario customization decision 'Random Rulers,' which applies a new set of random yet coherent traits (including all extended traits) to startup rulers and their families (credit goes to MFCamillus for finding the source of the crash in the old version and adding diplomat trait allocation)
- Characters will no longer beg for titles while they're commanding troops during war
- More military define tweaks
	+ Slight improvement in levy reinforce rate
	+ Nerf to retinue reinforce rate (same as levy-- ideally, it'd be less...)
	+ Retinues cost more to hire, maintain, and reinforce
- Overhauled holy order recruitment events so they use a centralized proxy event; recruitment now ignores married characters (unless they're without young children) and ignores expel modifiers
- Can no longer gain Craven in battle by totally random event, likewise gaining Brave is considerably more rare
- Import and further modification of some vanilla traits from PB (piety effects, some attributes, lot of blanket vassal_opinion changes, etc.)
- Fabrication of claims is now faster for these cases:
	+ Faster in capital duchy
	+ Faster if directly bordering _demesne_ province(s)
- Chancellor can fabricate claims on duchies with lower diplomacy (as little as 12); encourages less unlanding of original characters and spices things up (still unlikely)
- Adopted councillor opinion effects on all jobs' performance from PB
- Non-SoA version of heresy events: now also use the more gradual religious authority curve for heresy spread
- [Regional] Added modifier icons for all seasonal events
- Added new icons for Find Hobby ambition, Legalize Cooperation faction, and VF leader traits
- SoA version of heresy events: More gradual acceleration of heresy spread with lower religious authority (less feedback)
- Nerfed College of Cardinals elector points awarded by bishop's Dynasty Prestige to 10% rather than 100%
- Overhauled lifestyle events so they go through a centralized handler event and no longer have wildly differing mean time to happen
- Added Find Hobby ambition for folks looking to pick up a lifestyle trait a little faster
- Static modifier overrides for EMF and EMF+SWMH (similar to PB's baseline but a misc. diff, incl. different holding base_values and added age modifiers) 
- [DynamicLevies] Recentered the levy efficiency law modifier curve upon the default (0 = 100%)
- Tweaked religious authority defines for better balance and less pathological heresy behavior
	AUTHORITY_FROM_ORG_RELIGION = 0.3 (from 0.2)
	AUTHORITY_FROM_ANTIPOPE = -0.2 (from -0.3)
- Doubled the base MTTH for title and marriage begging events
- Brought in the Traveling trait, which was "stolen" from VIET
- [Regional] Localization added, squashed bugs in modifier effects and some triggers, still missing new icons but should otherwise be 100% functional
- [Regional] Rebuilt regional module, dropping recursive approach because it can cause crashes
- [VF] Added another legalization ultimatum letter variant and general text cleanup
- [Regional] Removed seasonal notification events
- [Regional] Added seasonal modifier effects, values might still need work
- [Regional] Renamed Weather module to Regional and implemented seasonal events handed out through province sweeps
- [Weather] Added basic province sweeping functionality. Right now it doesn't do anything beyond flag every province.
- Directly integrated standard VIET congenital traits
- Removed conservative trait
- Removed obsolete liege levy maluses from Decentralized HRE and Themes laws and associated triggered modifiers
- Direct integration of PB's crown [but not succession] laws
- Tweaked retinue defines: fully-default constant cost, fully-PB % increase per tech level, 5x PB's hire cost
- Tweaks to liberal/conservative traits
- Placeholder trait icon de-uglified to make playtesting bearable
- Updated dynlevy system to fix savegame restoration flaw and add UI visibility of current levy efficiency (not save-compatible)

0.9.0 [ALPHA]
- Tweaked levy defines further (nerfing, changed items marked with [*]):
	CAPITAL_COUNTY_VASSAL_LEVY_MULT = 1.25[*]

	CAPITAL_EMPIRE_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.8[*]
	OUTSIDE_LEVY_MULT = 1
	OUTSIDE_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.7[*]
- [VF] Added faction_vf_legalize_cooperation CB
- [VF] Added VF cooperation laws, VF legalization faction and ultimatum scripting (lacking CB, localisation, and faction icon)
- [VF] Added leadership traits, placeholder icons, and CB with unimplemented supplementary events for legalizing the VF
- [SmartTactics] Adjusted unit maintenance to vanilla levels, except for Archers
- [SmartTactics] Nerfed Pikemen skirmish defense
- [SmartTactics] Added first draft of smart tactics system - a unit that has 30% of a given troop will use tactics that benefit that troop
- Added vanilla and PB on_actions, registered dynlevy title transfer events to listen to new on_actions
- [DynamicLevies] Adjusted parameters of curve to cover the realm_size range (15,330) with nonlinear levy law modifier [1,0.5]
- Added version.txt for installer
- Startup flavor series removed due to deterministic random seed at scenario start
- Demesne focus made more flexible and law modifier equations improved, Iqta enjoys better tax conversion efficiency, laws rebalanced
- Demesne focus/obligations law sliders now auto-generated, focus slider equation needs more work
- [DynamicLevies] Initial implementation (sans revolt levy efficiency handling) ready to test
- [DynamicLevies] Completed proper scaling curve, adjusted parameters, current levy efficiency % should display in Laws now
- [DynamicLevies] Add scenario initialization evt for subsystem
- [DynamicLevies] Added complete codegen output for dynlevy law setting event
- Added a crappy generic placeholder trait icon and the definition of the liberal and conservative traits
- Started drafting EMF's tweaked defines.lua. Base template was from PB. Assume PB overrides of vanilla are
  inherited, and otherwise note all of the following points of divergence, file-ordered (remainder of file to go):
	CALL_TO_WAR_DELAY = 48 (4 years, from 5) [Encourage higher alliance participation]

	ASK_FOR_CLAIM_INTERACTION_THRESHOLD_FOR_YES = 125 (-25) [Attempt to make this SoA feature actually work sometimes, 50v125]
	CHANGE_AMBITION_YEARS = 1 (-1 from PB, -2 from vanilla) [More active ambition selection involvement]
	ASSIGN_ACTION_DAYS = 0 (60 in PB, 183 in vanilla) [Various reasons]
	MAX_GENERATED_TRAITS_FOR_HISTORICAL = 5 (+1) [More variance, more aligned w/ actual accumulated adult trait counts]
	LUNATIC_TRAIT_CHANCE_FACTOR = 0.4 (+100%) [From inbreeding: far, far too rare at default]
	LUNATIC_DIVINE_BLOOD_TRAIT_CHANCE_FACTOR = 0.4 [Consistency w/ above]
	MAX_REPUBLIC_COUNTIES_IN_REALM = 0.2 (+100%) [Encourage slightly more freedom in diversity of government types, patch 2.0 default was too low]
	EMPIRE_DEJURE_COUNTY_LIMIT_TO_CREATE = 0.667 (2/3 rule, -11% from PB, -16.5% from vanilla)
	AUTHORITY_FROM_RELHEAD_DIPLOMACY = 0.025 (-50% from 0.05) [Balancing overpowered catholic MA]

	TRADE_POST_OPINION_EFFECT = 0.5 (-33% from PB, +25% from vanilla) [More readily allow cross-[religion|culture]_group trade, previously barred]
	DOGE_SUCC_RANDOM_FACTOR = 500 (return to vanilla)
	OVER_MAX_DEMESNE_TAX_PENALTY = 0.20 (return to vanilla)
	LOOT_EVERY_X_DAYS = 4 (+2, return to vanilla) [Discourages Norse exploit where looting succeeds before levies can ever be raised against them]
	LOOT_IDEAL_MIN_TROOPS = 500 (-500, return to vanilla) [Makes non-Norse raiding more useful]

	LEVY_MAINTENANCE_FACTOR = 1.75 (-12.5% from PB, +16.67% from vanilla) [More fair levy vs. mercenary maint. ratio than PB, relatively favors AI, allows wars to be longer]
	OPINION_WHEN_NO_LEADER = 0 (return to vanilla) [Exploitation of -100 has apparently broken since that change: liege levy subunits never contain commanders; experiment w/ default]
	BATTLE_WARSCORE_WORTH = 100 (-25 from PB, +25 from vanilla) [War is longer, more difficult, more costly, allies have time to arrive, and multiple battles + sieging is nec.]
	BATTLE_WARSCORE_DEFENDER_MULTIPLIER = 1.6 (+14% from PB, +7% from vanilla) [Favor defensive wins, favors AI: defender does not have advantage of having prepared]
	MIN_LEVY_RAISE_OPINION_THRESHOLD = -100 (-50 from PB, -100 from vanilla) [Allow full range of opinion to affect liege levy, simpler liege levy calculation, favors AI]
	LEVY_PERCENT_BEFORE_CAN_RAISE = 0.3 (+50%) [Severely reduces "whack-a-mole" stupidity]
	BATTLE_TECH_MULTIPLIER = 0.5 (+50%, return to vanilla) [Tech self-regulates with non-linear, continously scaled ahead penalty, higher mil. tradition => higher mil. tech avg]

	COASTAL_SUPPLY_BONUS = 0.5 (return to vanilla)
	ARMY_LOAD_MOVE_COST = 30.0 (+50%) [Much slower to load into a galley for departure than to jump out of it and exploitatively raid coastal provinces]

	OVERRUN_RATIO = 21 (+40% from PB, -16% from vanilla) [More battles will be required to decisively defeat an army]
	LEADER_MARTIAL_DAMAGE_BONUS = 0.05 (-37.5% from PB, return to vanilla) [If set too high, heavily favors the player & can make for unrealistically bloody battles]
	WAR_CONTRIBUTION_OCCUPATION_PER_DAY = 15 (+50%) [Occupation is underrated, consistent with PB's elevated battle contribution factor]

	[Retinue AI pays attention to hire and reinforce cost while assuming constant cost is free. Citizen soldiers cost to recruit, train, and equip, but they live free off wherever cities. Ergo, their plausible cost model follows:]
	RETINUE_HIRE_COST_MULTIPLIER = 0.08 (+300% from PB, return to vanilla)
	RETINUE_REINFORCE_COST = 1.65 (-17.5% from PB, +17.9% from vanilla)
	RETINUE_CONSTANT_COST = 0.03 (-0.37 from PB, +INF% from vanilla)
		[Overhead while soldiers are free to do as they please and are living off the cities in which they're presently located are 1/50th of active reinforcement cost: recruiting, training, possibly mounting (teehee), and equipping]
	[Full set of levy / liege levy size multipliers provided for reference. Totally experimental: primary goal is to deemphasize patch 2.0's de jure liege levy maluses and simplify behavior, as that should complement realm_size-scaled liege levies much better.  Indeed, realm_size-scaled liege levies make de jure tier liege levy factor confusing, obsolete, and arbitrary.  The capital duchy/county bonuses are important for centralization strategy encouragement, though. These semantics enforce all balance and centralization strategy goals, AFAIK.]
	 LIEGE_LEVY_SIZE_MULTIPLIER = 0.5 (-50%, return to vanilla) [50% of troops stay in vassal subrealm, no magic troops, consistent with UI]

- FIX: Logic error regarding flag duration in 90-day pulse

- Added isis quarterly maintenance pulse for weather events (and whatever else)
	Implemented in style of high-priority AI decision: quite accurate timing, such accuracy

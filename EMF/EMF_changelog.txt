EMF 1.1 [BETA]
	Reformed Norse may now use the Holy War and Religious Reconquest CBs across sea zones before the year 1100
		For the Holy War CB, the attacker still needs to have at least Internal King's Peace and Crown Levies beyond None for non-bordering wars
	PB FIX: Holy War CB properly enforces the Crown Authority restrictions for non-neighboring wars (accounting for Emperor's Peace and ensuring the attacker has a crown law title)

EMF 1.0
	Dynamic levies: For all rulers, liege levy-raising efficiency scales down with increasing realm size, the number of holdings in the ruler's (sub-)realm, on a very finely-grained nonlinear curve.
		This curve effectively balances large, decentralized realms; it relatively boosts smaller, more centralized realms; and yet it still ensures reliable and reasonable returns upon army size from conquest at every level.
		Players will note that total army sizes for large, decentralized realms are much smaller than they'd normally expect.
		Since all troop counts have been taken down a notch and the difference between larger and smaller realms (or vassals and lieges) significantly reduced, the world is alive with a much more dynamic AI when it comes to war.
		Players can see their current levy efficiency by scrolling down to the bottom of the Laws screen, where they will find a Levy Efficiency law, its associated percentage, and its effects in a tooltip.
		More information on the curve itself (which differs slightly between SWMH and vanilla maps) and its properties will be made public at a later date.
		NOTE: Currently, there might be a _cosmetic_ bug wherein it appears more than one dynlevy (dynamic levy) law is applied at once. In truth, only one of them is active, and it'll be automatically fixed when you change realm_size tiers (5-6 holdings/tier, so frequently). We've only seen this once, and it may have already been solved, but should players run into it, we've provided a debug event to cleanup the Laws view:
			Open up the console and invoke: event emf_dynlevy.24
	When a liege raises his liege levy, only half of the troops in a given vassal's subrealm are raised (vanilla-- in PB, it's 100%)
	PB-style demesne law sliders (Focus and Obligations) have been rewritten to provide different, easier to analyze effects that better complement the new liege levy system and make far more combinations realistically valid strategic choices.
		All vassal classes (castle, city, temple) contribute equal liege levy percentage changes for each law.  Ergo, liege levy army composition is far more balanced than previously.
		A player with a larger realm will find far more benefit than previously in increasing vassal obligations or, potentially, focusing upon levies rather than taxes, due to the countervailing effects of dynamic levies.
	Weather system that considers terrain, season, and other factors is constantly running in the background, serving its meteorologic might upon clusters of provinces throughout the world. If a province is so included in a regional anomaly, it will experience major effects upon levy sizes, taxes, local army movement speed, and more.
		Look for snazzy new weather-related province modifier icons when selecting a province on the map.
		Though effects are short-lived (seasonal), beware modifiers affecting movement speed during tactical campaigns, and take advantage of enemy levy size weaknesses.
	Smart Tactics System. Combat tactics have been completely overhauled for more realistic combat tactics, outcomes, cultural command differences, and overall balance.
		Tactics as a whole have been standardized to prevent certain compositions from excelling beyond the norm. For example, English Massive Longbow Volley is now only as powerful as the other cultural tactics.
		Every culture has a cultural tactic now, instead of just a few. These cultural tactics are designed to match their unique retinue or cultural building, so that those compositions will excel.
		No longer will having a few stray units of a different type cause their tactic to pop up. Now having a large group of a single unit will completely force out irrelevant tactics.
		Taking a page from Better Army's and ClearCombat's books, every tactic has Good/Neutral/Bad variations. Even a Bad tactic is better than no tactic, but better commanders will use better tactics and be more effective overall.
		By bringing the bonuses from particular tactics in line with those from technology, terrain, cultural differences, and leadership, the player gets more of what they expect from combat without dumbing-down any of the relevant factors.
	All mercenary companies' compositions completely rebalanced to synergize with the cultural tactics relevant to their origin and generally be more effective with regard to Smart Tactics.
	Independence Factions are now far more rowdy.
	2 new Muslim holy orders: 1 Shia (the Saqaliba), and 1 Sunni (the Arsiyah).
	Rebalanced holy order compositions and sizes to fit better in a dynamic levies world (fewer troops) and generally provide no implausible, runaway advantage to Christians, Muslims, or reformed pagans.
	Norse females may lead Norse troops (and serve as marshals). All hail Shield-Maiden Lagertha!
	Updated retinue model. Retinues cost more while reinforcing, and their reinforce rate is as slow as the levy reinforce rate. They have a smaller constant cost.
	Decentralized HRE and Themes System modifiers changed.
	Wars are more unpredictable, generally not decided by single battles, and take longer while allies are far more relevant.
	[Scenario Customization Decision] Lucky Rulers: Assigns a collection of rulers a special, inherited Lucky Ruler trait that ensures they will be interesting to watch and/or rival.
	[Scenario Customization Decision] Resurrected 'Random Rulers,' which applies a new set of random yet coherent traits (incl. all extended traits) to startup rulers and their families (credit to MFCamillus for finding the source of the crash in the old version and adding diplomat trait distribution).
	[Scenario Customization Decision] Vanilla Crusades: players may choose to use the vanilla Crusade mechanic (updated in CKII 2.0) rather than PB's different, custom mechanic.
	Until Charlemagne's promised overhaul of decadence, decadence's positive and negative effects have been completely removed.
		Decadence events, tribal invasions, faction effects, and Decadent trait distribution also disabled.
		Players can simply disregard whatever decadence value their dynasty has, although it should rarely change.
	[Ambition] Pledge Peace for 15 Years (can be repeated)
		Garners immediate vassal opinion and a defensive liege levy boost so long as the pledge is not broken.
		You will be punished if you break the pledge, although it's not particularly easy to accidentally do so (CBs, e.g., will be greyed-out).
		Significant bonuses upon completion.
	[Ambition] Win a War (can be repeated)
	[Ambition] Win a Holy War (can be repeated)
		For both of these ambitions, winning a defensive war also counts, all religious wars count for the latter-- not just Holy War, and all types of war count for the former.
	[Ambition] Find a Hobby
		Increases chances of gaining a lifestyle trait
	Tons of improvements to PB and/or vanilla to reduce event spam/incoherency/immersion-breaking while improving plausibility. Notable examples:
		Doubled the base MTTH for title and marriage begging events.
		Overhauled lifestyle events to be more varied and no longer have wildly differing MTTHs.
		Can no longer gain Craven in battle by totally random event. Likewise, gaining Brave is considerably more rare.
		Holy order recruitment now ignores married characters (unless they're without young children) and whether the holy order was "expelled" from the realm.
		Characters will no longer beg for titles while they're commanding troops during war.
		Characters captured via a siege will now defer any request for mercy for 1 year, after which a 50% longer MTTH applies to mercy requests.
	Tweaks to many vanilla traits for piety gain, lower vassal_opinion impacts, more advantages to previously "bad" traits like Content, etc.
	Republics have been notably de-nerfed-- as part of your realm, while watching them, and while playing as one.
	Chancellor can fabricate claims on duchies with lower diplomacy (as little as 12). Encourages less unlanding of original characters, although it is still unlikely.
	Fabrication of claims is now faster for these cases:
		Faster in capital duchy
		Faster if directly bordering _demesne_ province(s)
	Altered skill curve for councillors that also happens to support job efficacy gains at all skill levels up to and including 30.
	Free Investiture is now more attractive:
		It grants +8 opinion from vassals with bishops and +20 opinion from bishops to their direct lieges.
		Bishops now only inherently like the Pope with +15 opinion rather than +20.
	Royal marriage alliances ("Marriage Ties") yield +40 opinion rather than +30 opinion. Consider marrying your daughters to vassals.
	Lieges no longer inherently dislike faction members, and vassals may join 1 more faction than previously (everybody's in the Autonomy Faction).
	Combat trait advancement (with and without corresponding ambitions selected) is now much more likely from leading troops or winning duels.
	Combat trait advancement ambitions are now half as likely to be selected by the AI.
	Heresy spread should now be more gradual until a religion's authority truly plummets, at which point heresy takeover is more likely.
	Crusades/Jihads can be called with a 40% religious authority minimum, rather than 50%. Other changes to Crusade requirements to more closely follow vanilla.
	Catholic 'Request for Invasion' now more likely to be successful and requires only 40% religious authority, rather than 50%
	Catholic 'Ask for Claim' now more likely to be successful and costs only 50 piety instead of 100
	Serious piety boost for building new temples (i.e., granting them to a bishop), especially count-tier temples
	Minimum amount of de jure territory required to form or usurp an empire dropped to 2/3
	Secondary spouses are now significantly less fertile
	Marriage defines tweaked to deemphasize pro-blobbing unions at the risk of more strange unions (only axis of moddability)
	Takes advantage of the new static modifiers for age groups which were added in CKII 2.1 for modders and no longer uses the "old age" event.
		Ages 0-15:  health -0.5
		Ages 16-19: health +0.5, fertility +5%, sex_appeal_opinion +5, liege_opinion -10 (opinion of liege)
		Ages 20-29: health +0.5, fertility +10%, sex_appeal_opinion +5
		Ages 50-59: health -1.0, fertility -10%, sex_appeal_opinion -5
		Ages 60-99: health -2.0, fertility -15%, sex_appeal_opinion -10
	Councillors may be immediately reassigned.
	Players need only wait 1 year after activation to be able to cancel their ambition.
	De jure territory bonuses/penalties to levies have been significantly "flattened." Closer to a pre-CKII-2.0 setup than previously, it simplifies matters significantly with regard to dynamic levies, and promotes centralization (strong demesne, keeping vassals balkanized, etc.), as it applies to every ruler's capital:
		CAPITAL_COUNTY_VASSAL_LEVY_MULT = 1.25
		CAPITAL_COUNTY_LEVY_MULT = 1.5
		CAPITAL_COUNTY_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_DUCHY_VASSAL_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_DUCHY_LEVY_MULT = 1.25
		CAPITAL_DUCHY_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_KINGDOM_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_KINGDOM_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.9
		CAPITAL_EMPIRE_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_EMPIRE_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.8
		OUTSIDE_LEVY_MULT = 1
		OUTSIDE_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.7
	Countless tweaks to PB/vanilla defines and modifiers, significantly changing gameplay behavior.
	An excess of changes that were made to both PB and EMF over the last couple months that need not be duplicated in this log.
